Let's imagine you want to play with a new language or technology. To do this you need:

1. Some tutorial or exercise or [katas](https://www.codewars.com/)/[koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/)
2. Development environment... and it is not that simple

**Side note**: possible candidates for exercise are: [MAL](https://github.com/kanaka/mal), [todomvc](http://todomvc.com/), [hnpwa](https://hnpwa.com/), [realworld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld).

## Development environment

When I want to play - I want to jump directly to coding. I don't want to figure out what is [the state of the art for tooling](https://dev.to/stereobooster/what-do-you-use-for-python-development-4706). I don't want to spend hours installing tools and configuring IDE. I don't want to break any existing dev environments or remember which things to uninstall after the experiment.

[Visual Studio Code Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) is a solution to the problem if you already use VS Code and Docker. It takes no time to spin up a new development environment with preconfigured tooling. This is what I call "[Truly Integrated Development Environment](/posts/truly-integrated-development-environment/)".

I've been working with it for a couple of weeks and so far the experience was delightful. So I decided to collect recipes for dev containers for my future experiments: **[Awesome VS Code Containers](https://github.com/stereobooster/awesome-vscode-dev-containers)**.

## PS

I already [tried out Pony](https://github.com/stereobooster/pony-lisp). Next, I want to play with Crystal, Unison, Racket, and Haskell. **With what technology or language do you want to experiment?**

Happy hacking!
