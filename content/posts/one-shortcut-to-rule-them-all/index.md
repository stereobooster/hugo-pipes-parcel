or an ode to command palette.

<!--more-->

Many editors adopted this idea after Sublime - when you type <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac OS)or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Windows, Linux) it will open command palette, where you can easily find all actions (with or without shortcuts). This is very powerful idea - you don't need to remember all shortcuts, you can simply find one. And eventually you will memorize most used ones.

Support across IDEs (or text-editors if you like):

- VSCode: built-in
- onivim 2: built-in
