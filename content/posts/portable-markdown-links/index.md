**aka** relative links, local links, file path links. Software supports **portable markdown links** if for content like this:

```md
[test](folder/test.md)
```

- For **editor**: user can <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + Click the link and editor will jump to that file
- For **static website generator**: file pahts are replaced by URLs according generation scheme, for example: `[test](folder/test.md)` â†’ `<a href="/folder/test/">test</a>`

## Example

[portable-hugo-links](https://github.com/bep/portable-hugo-links) shows how same links work in Github and website generated by Hugo.

## Features

- Links: `[readme](/readme.md)`, which also includes resolution of relative and absolute paths:
  - `[readme](../readme.md)`
  - `[readme](./readme.md)`
  - `[readme](readme.md)`
- Anchors: `[readme](/readme.md#heading)`
  - for editor: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + Click should navigate to specified section
  - for static website generator: anchors should be preserved in html links
- Images: `![alt](img.jpg)`
  - for editor's preview: images should be displayed
  - for static website generator: images should be displayed

## Naming

Why do I call it **portable**? Because this simple convention allows to use same markdown files with different software wihtout modifications. In the same vein, we can think of portable markdown frontmatter, etc.

A bit of convention over configuration goes long way.
