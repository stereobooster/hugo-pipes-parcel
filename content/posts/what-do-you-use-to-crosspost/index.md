I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate the blog, store source in [github](https://github.com/stereobooster/stereobooster.com), host it with [netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

At the moment I semi-automatically crosspost to dev.to (because my RSS isn't full articles, as well I need to add tags and cover image).

### What I want?

I want fully automated posting to 3-rd party platforms (from CI server). Bonus points: if it will update articles when I edit original posts.

**What would you use to do this?**

### Where do I want to crosspost?

- dev.to (for sure)
- Medium (various Medium communities)
- Hacker News
- Reddit (maybe, I don't use it)
- Lobsters (maybe, I have no account)
- hashnode (saw it recently, have no idea what is it)

**Where would you crosspost?**

### PS

In case you wonder why:

- platforms can delete your posts, for example, Tumblr incident
- one platform can block another platform, for example, Reddit shadow bans dev.to
- paywalls, for example, Medium place articles behind the paywall
- your posts can be blocked for geo-political reasons
- etc.
