This website uses [TinyAnalytics](https://tinyanalytics.io/) to analyze traffic. I don't store any cookies on the device

The only reason I want to collect data about your visits to this site is to understand which articles are popular and which are not. This is important for me as an author, because sometimes I don't get any other feedback.

This website is a static website, so I don't have server logs to analyze it. Instead, I need to use 3-rd party service provider.
